# GTA2
Creates a top down arcade style camera, similar to GTA2; another Rockstar Title.


# Notes
This is a WIP mod, from old code that I wish to restart. Ignore most of this until I actually announce a release

# Function

i.      This mod intends on replicating the arcade style camera similar to that of GTA2

ii.     As of the current code, it is constantly set, with a way to break out. 

iii.    As of writing this readme, it is untested, and knowing my code, won't work yet. 

iv.     It is currently residing in STimeCycle.lua however will eventually be moved to its own "main" script, launched within STimeCycle. 

v.      I have no idea when this will be finished.
